## ðŸ“Š About the Project  
This project explores the complex journey of human trafficking survivors, with a specific focus on the challenges they face in securing T Visas in the United States. The T Visa is a nonimmigrant status that allows victims of human trafficking to remain in the U.S. and rebuild their lives. However, the application process is arduous and restrictive, leaving many survivors without the protection they need.

## ðŸ“ˆ About the Visualization  
This interactive data story visualizes the demographics of the victims, the application of T Visas, and NTAs issued.  
Demographics of the victims:  
1. Each dot represents a victim, and by highlighting the dots, you can see the proportion of each demographic group. I created the plot with ggplot in R, view the [victims.R] files for the code.
2. The scrollytelling template is based on this [template](https://github.com/jsoma/page-templates/).

The application of T Visas and NTAs issued:  
Created with Datawrapper.

## ðŸ“š About Data Sources  
National Human Trafficking Hotline: This data, sourced from the hotline, tracks the number of human trafficking cases reported and identifies key demographics of the victims. The numbers used are from [Polaris Analysis of 2021 Data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline](https://polarisproject.org/resources/us-national-human-trafficking-hotline-statistics/).  
USCIS T Visa Data: Information on T Visa approvals, denials, and the criteria for receiving a T Visa. Published [here](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/fact-sheets/Characteristics_of_T_Nonimmigrant_Status_TVisa_Applicants_FactSheet_FY08_FY22.pdf).

## ðŸ›  Work Done  
- Read reports from the National Human Trafficking Hotline and Polaris to understand victim demographics and T Visa data.  
- Interviewed Jean Stockdale, Program Director at Still Waters, to learn more about T Visas.  
- Read Boston University's research on T Visas and how it intersects with NTAs.  
- Created interactive charts with Datawrapper for the application of T Visas and NTAs issued.  
- Developed scatter plots using ggplot in R to visualize victim demographics.  
- Styled the website with custom CSS and HTML to enhance user experience with the help of ChatGPT (view conversation [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67bb94b7-2c78-8013-8040-e912adad7880))
